# History of the Internet
The 20th centuty was defined by broadcast communications like television and radio,
where the information was sent from one source to the many receivers.
Thought the telephone allowed for individuals to talk to each other,
this form of communication involved only two people in the majority of cases.
Everything has changed with the invention of the Internet.
Now thousands, millions or even billions of people can communicate simultaneously.

## The Early Beginning of the Internet
With the launch of the Sputnik satellite in 1957,
America feared that the Soviet Union would get an edge in technological development
and even militarize the space, theatening the secutity of the nation.
ARPA (Advanced Research Project Agency),
now known as DARPA (Defence Advanced Research Project Agency),
was the agency, created specifically to create technologies
that would help the US military to get a technological advantage over the Soviets.

The first ideas about a network of interconnected computers were formed in 1962.
First described by J.C.R. Licklider of MIT,
the "Galactic Network" is a network of computers connected to each other in some way
that could access information in electronic form from one another.
This and the US Air Force desire to create a decentralized network of communications
that could be operational even after the nuclear strike,
layed the groundwork for the computer research program at ARPA.

## The Packet Switching Theory
Another player that influenced the creation of the Internet was Paul Beran,
who suggested a way to achieve decentralization using "packet switching" in a network.

The basic idea of packet switching is that the data is subdivided into multiple packets
each containing the origin address and the destination address in the network.
Such packets can be routed independently through the network,
they may even take completely different paths from one another.
On the receiving end these packets are combined back into the original data.
And if something gets lost on the way,
the receiver can ask the sender to send only the missing parts of the data again.

## The First Internet -- ARPANET
The original Internet was known as the ARPANET.
It was established in 1969 and consisted of only 4 Honeywell minicomputers
located at four universities: University of California at Santa Barbara,
the University of California at Los Angeles, SRI at Stanford and the University of Utah.
The original network speed was 2.4Kbps which was later improved to 50Kbps.

### The Internet Progresses into the 1970s
During the 1970s another 19 computers were hooked to the ARPANET network.
The network speed, however, still stayed at 50Kbps.

1972 signified a major development of the ARPANET -- 
the introduction of the killer app -- Email.
Created by Ray Tomlin at BBN Corporation the original invention was very crude,
but it gave the ARPANET a great application.

### A New Protocol is Created
Originally ARPANET's core protocol -- NCP (Network Control Protocol)
only worked with specific types of computers.
To combat this major design flaw and allow more computers to become a part of the network
new protocols had to be developed.
The Internet protocol suite, commonly known as TCP/IP, became the solution.
Created in 1973 it was firstly used to communicate between computers in 1974.
It is still in use today, forming the backbone of internet communications.

### ARPANET grows Beyond the United States
As the 1970s unfolded many innovations took place that expanded ARPANETâ€™s
reach past the shores of America and around the world for the first time. 
The ARPANET expanded without the help of a fixed line,
instead using satellite radio waves to transmit data packets.
The first satellite link -- SATNET connected the USA and Europe
The ARPANET grew bigger than a military project,
as the satellites that were used in SATNET were owned by a consortium of several countries.

### Making the Connection Easier and Quicker
While SATNET expanded the reach of the ARPANET,
connecting new computers was still difficult.
The creation of the Ethernet cable, which is still used today, aimed to solve this problem.
The single cable not only made the connection to the network much simpler,
it also increased the data transfer speeds.

Another major innovation of the 1970s was UUCP (Unix to Unix Copy) --
a protocol enabling computers to easily send and receive files.
Over the years UUCP would grow into Usenet,
which is still used by many people to share files, emails and news over the Internet.

As the 1970s drew to a close ARPANET was changed drastically.
Now it consisted of over 100 computers linked to the same network
spanning multiple countries separated by the ocean.
However the connection speed of 50Kbps was still an obstacle.

## The Internet Continues to Grow in the 1980s
There are many reasons for the drastic changes of the Internet in the 1980s.
One of them was the technological advancement in computer design.
Computers became widespread in universities, businesses and ultimately at people's homes.
With the advancement of computers came new organizations to manage many new users
utilizing the Internet in many different forms.
During the ten year period the number of computer hosts reached 200,000.
The Internet took off.

### The Early 1980s
During the 1980s, ARPANET dominated the Internet, but other networks emerged,
including the Computer Science Network (CSNET) created by the National Science Foundation.
Although it was primarily focused on scientific research,
CSNET became an alternative for those who could not connect to the ARPANET,
which was still a military project.
In 1981, a plan was implemented to allow connection of ARPANET and CSNET,
making communication easier.

Another innovation that improved internet communication was the creation of DNS
(Domain Name System), which made it easier to connect with other computers.
DNS allowed users to remember the name of the site or server they were connecting to.
As DNS became took hold, other protocols became mandatory,
with computers on ARPANET and CSNET no longer working with NCP
and requiring TCP/IP for connection.

### Big Events in 1985
In the early to mid-1980s the Internet experienced significant growth
due to advancements in technology and hardware.
Moore's Law, which states that a computer chip doubles in power and halves in price
every 18 months, led to increased demand for communication and global connectivity.
In 1985, the ARPANET, initially created for military purposes, was split into two networks,
MILNET and ARPANET with the former being used for strictly military purposes
and the latter being available for all.

Also in 1985, CSNET was upgraded to T-1 lines,
delivering faster data transfer speeds of up to 1.5Mbps.
To use these lines efficiently new technologies were needed.
IBM, for instance, created advanced routers and a company called Merit managed the network.
The new upgraded network, NSFNET (National Science Foundation Network), was launched in 1986.

In the mid-1980s, the Internet experienced a significant surge in traffic,
reaching 200,000 hosts by 1989.
While the T-1 line offered speeds of up to 1.5 Mbps,
the T-3 line was already in the works. It allowed data transfer speed of 45 Mbps.

## The Internet as We Know It
The Internet, launched in 1969, grew significantly in the 1980s and 1990s,
becoming a household appliance and caused an economic boom.
While it grew, it required powerful home computers, software, technological advances,
and applications to make it accessible to common people.

### The Internet in the early 1990s
In the 1990s, the Internet experienced significant growth due to various innovations,
including social and commercial spheres.
The T-3 line, which increased communication speed to 45 Mbps,
which retired the slower CSNET network.
The National Research and Education Network (NREN) was established
to conduct high-speed networking research.
The number of host computers on the Internet grew from 300,000 in the early 1990s
to billions today.
The Internet has transformed society and has had a profound impact on every aspect of our lives.

### The World Wide Web
The World Wide Web (WWW) -- one of the most important innovations of the Internet --
is a platform that enables easy access to data on the Internet using hypertext links.
Created in 1989 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, Sir Sam Walker, and Robert Caillau,
it was introduced publicly on August 6, 1991, marking the Internet's takeoff.
The Web's popularity was largely due to its free,
one-way links and lack of licensing restrictions.

The first web browser, Mosaic, was released in 1993 and revolutionized
the way users accessed information and data on the web.
As the project grew, it became the Netscape browser, led by Marc Andreessen.
The Dot.com boom in 1995 marked the beginning of the Dot.com boom, changing the industry forever. 
Today, most computer users access the Internet via a browser,
such as Microsoft's Internet Explorer or Mozilla's Firefox.

In the early 90s, Microsoft dominated the web browser market with Mosaic and Netscape.
They promoted their Internet Explorer (IE) browser by bundling it with Windows 98.
Netscape, which originally had 85% of the market share, was used by less than 1% by 2003.
Today, IE remains the dominant browser on Windows computers,
but other browsers like Firefox, Google's Chrome, and Safari
have impacted Microsoft's market share.
The web's rapid growth necessitated a directory system,
leading to the development of search engines like Yahoo!.

### The First Mainstream Search Engine is Created
In the early 1990s, the web was a vast repository of information,
but organizing it was challenging.
In 1994 Jerry Yang with his friend created Jerry's Guide to the World Wide Web,
now known as Yahoo!.
Yahoo!, incorporated in 1995, initially served as a directory of websites
but now offers web-oriented services like email, instant messaging, and news.

## Google, Today's Ultimate Search Engine
Google, which also started at a university as a research project
to improve web search effectiveness,
took over the title of the world's largest search engine a couople of years after Yahoo's launch.
Before Google, search engines used meta tags and on-page information to rank web pages.
However this system could be very easily gamed.
Google developed Page Rank,
an algorithm based on the weighted sum of ranks of pages linked to the page.
The more a web page correlated with topics,
the more relevant a page would be and this page would be ranked higher
for that specific search term.
Google's precision and clean home page attracted many users.
The company also monetized its technology with targeted text ads,
making it one of the most profitable companies in history.

## Accessing the Internet
The 1990s saw the rapid growth of the Internet due to its ease of access.
In the early 1990s, dial-up access was common, with speeds ranging from 14Kbps to 28Kbps.
In the late 90s, cable and DSL modems emerged,
using TV cable bandwidth and turning telephone connections into high-speed internet connections.
Dial-up service was affordable, but broadband was more expensive.
AOL, a leading ISP, combined internet access and created a community with numerous applications.

## AOL
AOL, along with Yahoo and Google, significantly aided the public in using the web.
Focusing on non-technical users, AOL offered easy experiences with its proprietary software.
AOL introduced numerous web services, including email, chat rooms, and instant messenger.
Despite having 30 million subscribers in the late 1990s,
its prominence diminished as broadband took over.

## The Many Applications for Internet Use
The Internet's growth is fueled by numerous applications and innovations,
making it a popular destination for individuals and businesses,
impacting communication and business operations.
Here are just a few of the technologies
that have a considerable impact on the way we communicate and do business.

### Email -- the Internet's Killer App
Email has become an essential tool for both business and personal communications,
making it a crucial aspect of the internet.
Originally conceived in 1972,
email has evolved from a simple text message to a comprehensive communication tool.
Today, it includes various media and hypertext links.
Email has also evolved from requiring a server to
free online services like Yahoo Mail, Hotmail, and Gmail.
Web-based email allows users to access and send messages from anywhere,
making it a global communication tool.

### The Innovation of the Forum
In the 80s and 90s, digital bulletin boards were used to access information on the Internet.
These small communities, similar to online communities,
allowed users to upload, download, or write messages.
Today, these forums provide a platform for discussing various topics,
fostering social interaction and contributing to the evolution of the Internet.

### Online Dating
Online dating has significantly impacted how we meet and date over the past two decades.
Initially, digital bulletin boards were used,
but AOL's popularity led to chat rooms becoming a popular way to meet people instantly.
With the demand for chat and meeting people, websites were created to cater to specific interests.

### Social Networking
The Internet's social aspects have been significantly enhanced by search engines,
web browsers, and ISPs.
Social networks like MySpace.com and Facebook.com have become massive,
allowing individuals to stay close to friends, join large online groups,
and mobilize for various political and social causes.
These platforms allow users to set up personal pages and keep track of friends.

### Blogs
Blogs have gained popularity as a way for individuals or organizations to communicate regularly,
offering commentary, news, thoughts, and occasional rants.
They are easy to update and can also include media like podcasts or vlogs.
Twitter, another type of blog, allows users to send smaller messages
less that 140 characters in length.
Both blogs and Twitter have become popular platforms for sharing ideas and thoughts.

## Economic Influence on the History of the Internet
The Internet has had a significant economic impact,
creating trillions of dollars in wealth and changing billions of lives through e-commerce.
The US government allowed commercial websites to operate on the Internet in 1991,
leading to the Dot.com Boom.
The first popular web browser, Netscape, went public,
causing a surge in demand for tech companies involved in the internet.
This IPO boom led to billions of dollars being directed towards the tech sector,
resulting in significant growth in the global economy.
The intertwined nature of world markets continues to this day.

### Google Goes Public
Another success story is Google.
Google, a premier search engine and one of the world's largest companies by market capitalization.
It has significantly contributed to small businesses' advertising through contextual text ads,
attracting traffic and monetizing content creators, thereby fostering quality web content.

### Business has Changed due to the Internet
Over the past 20 years, the computer and internet have significantly transformed
business operations, making it easier and more convenient.
Services like email, VOIP, cloud computing, and online banking have eliminated physical barriers,
allowing people to work from home or become tech nomads.
The Internet has grown from a few dozen computers to connecting the entire world,
with immense potential for the future.
