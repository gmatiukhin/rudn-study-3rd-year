# Unit 1

1. What are the main stages of the Internet development?
    1. The creation of ARPANET
    2. SATNET connects USA and Europe
    3. Introduction of UUCP
    4. Connection of ARPANET and CSNET
    5. Upgrade to T-1 lines to improve transfer speed
    6. Upgrade to T-3 lines and deprecating of CSNET
    7. Creation of the World Wide Web and the first browser -- Mosaic
    8. Creation of the first mainstreem search engine -- Yahoo!
2. What is the idea of packet switching?
    The basic idea of packet switching is that the data is subdivided into multiple packets
    each containing the origin address and the destination address in the network.
    Such packets can be routed independently through the network,
    they may even take completely different paths from one another.
    On the receiving end these packets are combined back into the original data.
    And if something gets lost on the way,
    the receiver can ask the sender to send only the missing parts of the data again.
3. What was the first configuration of a network of computers?
    ARPANET. It connected 4 computers at 4 US universities.
4. Why  was 1972 considered to be a banner year for the Internet?
    Email was invented.
5. What are the advantages of TCP/IP?
    It is a more inclusive protocol compared to NCP.
    It allows different computers to communicate freely.
6. How and when was it possible to expand ARPANET?
    SATNET (Sattelite Network) allowed ARPANET to connect to eropean networks.
7. Why was the Ethernet cable created?
    It made connection of computers to the network easier.
    Now you only need to plug in one cable.
8. What is Usenet?
    Usenet -- User's Network, is a worldwide distributed discussion system available on computers.
    It was developed from the UUCP (Unix-to-Unix Copy) network architecture.
    It is still used by many people to share files, emails and news over the Internet.
9. What were the innovations that improved communications between computers around the country and world in 1980â€™s?
    1. CSNET allowed users who could not connect to ARPANET, as that was still a military project,
    to get access to the network.
    Later on, these two networks were bridged.
    2. DNS (Domain Name System) was created to be a more user-friednly way
    to reach a specific computer. With it users didn't have to input IP addresses directly,
    instead they could use a memorable name in a natural language.
    3. CSNET was upgradet to T-1 lines, which allowed data transfer speeds to reach 1.5Mbps
10. Does the Internet and the World Wide Web mean the same?
    No. World Wide Web is an information system, that enables information sharing over the Internet.
    It is more user-friednly allowing general public to access files with the HTTP
    (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).
11. What search engines do you know?
    Yahoo!, Bing, Google, DuckDuckGo, Searx, Brave Search, Yandex
12. What makes it easier for the general public to use the Internet?
    Abundance of user-friednly pretty-looking apps which do all their communications under the hood,
    DNS which allows to only remember the name of a website,
    and search engines who search the Internet for you.
