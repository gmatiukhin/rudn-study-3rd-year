    - Frequency hopping
25. When can users experience interference or lose their connections?
    - If the router fails or if too many people try to use high-bandwidth applications at the same time
26. What should you do first if you want to take advantage of public WiFi hotspots or start a wireless network in your home?
    - Make sure your computer has the right gear
27. What will computer do if you turn it on in a WiFi hotspot?
    - The computer will inform you that the network exists and ask whether you want to connect to it. 
28. What do wireless home networks allow you to do?
    - They allow you to easily connect multiple computers and to move them from place to place without disconnecting and reconnecting wires.
29. What do you need if you have several computers that are not networked, or if you want to replace your Ethernet network?
    - A wireless router.
30. What does a wireless router contain?
    - A port to connect to your cable or DSL modem;
