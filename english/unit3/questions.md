1. What has become an important asset in today's business world?
    - Reliable and efficient access to information.
2. What an opportunity do coworkers thousands of miles apart have?
    - They can share information instantaneously.
3. What kind of services does the global computer network provide?
    - It allows consumers to buy books, clother and cars online, among countless other things.
4. What does networking allow?
    - It allows one computer to send information to and receive information from another computer.
5. How can we classify network technologies?
    - One of the ways to classify network technologies is the proximity of the devices in the network.
6. What is LAN?
    - LAN (short for Local Area Network) is a network which connects devices that are relatively close to each other, inside of the same building, for example.
7. What is WAN?
    - WAN (short for Wide Area Network) is a network that connects a number of devices far apart.
8. Give example of the usage of WAN technologies.
    - You can create a WAN of a university campus by connectin LANs of individual buildings together.
9. When did Bob Metcalfe design and test the first Ethernet network?
    - in 1973
10. What did Metcalfe develop?
    - He developed a physical method of cabling that connected devices on the Ethernet as well as a standard that governs all communication over the cable.
11. What did the original Ethernet describe?
    - A way of communication where many devices share a single cable between them.
12. Taking modern advancement into consideration, what distance can Ethernet devices have between them?
    - About a hundred meters.
13. What does the term protocol refer to in networking?
    - A set of rules that govern communications.
14. What does a common medium provide?
    - A path along which electronic signals travel.
15. What is the frame?
    - A chunk of information.
16. What must each frame include?
    - A destination and a source address.
17. What is critical to identify the intended recipient of the frame?
    - That the destination address is unique to the node.
18. What does a station do when it first receives a frame?
    - It checks whether the it is the destination of the frame.
19. What is one interesting thing about Ethernet addressing?
    - The implementation of a broadcast address. If frame's destination is set to the broadcast address it is sent to every node.
20. Is a frame with a destination address equal to the broadcast address intended for every nod on the network?
    - Yes.
21. What does the acronym CSMA/CD signify?
    - [c]arrier-[s]ense [m]ultiple [a]cces with [c]ollision [d]etection
22. When one Ethernet station transmits, do all the stations on the medium hear the transmission?
    - Yes.
23. Why does a station «listen» to the medium before it transmits?
    - Because it shouldn't transmit when another station is also doing that.
24. What do stations do when they detect a collision?
    - They back off and wait a random amount of time before retrying.
25. And the last question, what makes it unlikely that any two stations will collide more than a few times in a row?
    - It's because the delay they wait after a collision is random for all of them.
26. Are there any practical limits to the size of the Ethernet network? What is a primary concern?
    - The primary concern is the maximum Ethernet cable length, which is only a hundred meters. If you have a bunch of network devices like routers, switches and hubs you can make the network virtually endless, but the price of equipment will soon otweight the price of a fiber-optic link.
27. What can scramble the signal?
    - Electrical interference from other devices or cables.
28. What is another practical limit is there on an Ethernet network?
    - The quality of the signal decreases the longer it travels along the cable.
29. What is the function of repeaters in the network?
    - Repeaters amplify and restore the signal to its original strength.
30. How can we reduce congestion in a segment?
    - Split into into multiple smaller ones.
31. What do we use bridges for?
    - To connect several segments. They regulate traffic by not allowing frames enter the segments for which they have no destination.
32. How does the bridge reduce unnecessary traffic on both segments?
    - If the destination of a frame is inside of the first segment the bridge won't allow it to pass to the second one.
33. What is a router?
    - Routers divide a network into logical segments.
34. What allows routers to easily interconnect various network technologies?
    - They operate based on protocols that are independent from the specific networking technology.
35. What is the most striking advancement in contemporary Ethernet network?
    - The use of switched networks. Which allow creation of single-station mediums (basically allowing only one device on one cable).
36. What is the difference between a switch and a bridge?
    - Switches generally support more segments connected to them than to a bridge. They also filter frames not intended for a specific destination. And becuase there's always only a switch and a station on every segmens it allows many conversations to happen over the network.
37. What does the term full-duplex mean?
    - Full-duplex denote the ability to send and receive data at the same time.
38. What did "Ethernet" originally refer to?
    - A networking implementation standardized by Digital, Intel and Xerox.
39. When did the IEEE create a committee to standardize network technologies?
    - In February 1980.
40. Why was this working group titled 802?
    - It's titeled after the year and month of its formation.
41. Do Ethernet and 802.3 differ?
    - Only slightly in their terminology and data format for the frames.
