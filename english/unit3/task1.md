- If you live on the planet Earth you’ve probably seen an **RJ45 Ethernet** cable and a **jack** that goes into at some point so it'll be on the back of your computer and in the back of your **modem network switch** and then the cable **plugs into** it with a nice little **locking connector**.
- But what actually **performance** of this interface? The number one factor affecting the performance of the **link speed** is the **rated** link speed... The ports and the cables look the same **superficially**. You sometimes have to get down to see what speed is the device **capable of** running at.
- One of the **challenges** however is that the way that manufacturers **denote** the speeds can often vary.
- Make sure you have a cable that’s **rated for the correct speed** and the correct distance.
- Number one. I always do this first: take **the connecto** and plug it in and **pull it out**  a few times - this can **scratch off** any corrosion or **oxidation** on the connectors and can give you a better connection between **the cable itself** and the network interface card or the router.
- Check your cable run. Do you have any really **tight bends** or any **kinks** in the cable.
