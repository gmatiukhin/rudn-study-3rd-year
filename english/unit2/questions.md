    - TCP provides reliable, ordered and error-checked delivery of information between devices commuinicating via IP network
    - IP's task is to deliver packets from the source host to the destination host based on their IP addresses
4. What does each device connected to the Internet have?

14. Can you give examples of physical transmission lines?
    Cables

    Protocols create a framework within which all devices can communicate according to the rules of the protocol.
16. Where does our computer send an electronic request when we connect to the Web site?

18. What will happen if it doesn't find a match?

19. What are packets?
    Relatively small parts of an original file
20. What do packets have?
    Data about the sender and the receiver, as well as how this packet fits with the other to recreate the original file.
