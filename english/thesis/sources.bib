  abstract = {Over the last 5 years, the AI community has shown considerable
              interest in decentralized control of multiple decision makers or
              ``agents'' under uncertainty. This problem arises in many
              application domains, such as multi-robot coordination,
              manufacturing, information gathering, and load balancing. Such
              problems must be treated as decentralized decision problems because
              each agent may have different partial information about the other
              agents and about the state of the world. It has been shown that
              these problems are significantly harder than their centralized
              counterparts, requiring new formal models and algorithms to be
              developed. Rapid progress in recent years has produced a number of
              different frameworks, complexity results, and planning algorithms.
              The objectives of this paper are to provide a comprehensive
              overview of these results, to compare and contrast the existing
              frameworks, and to provide a deeper understanding of their
              relationships with one another, their strengths, and their
              weaknesses. While we focus on cooperative systems, we do point out
              important connections with game-theoretic approaches. We analyze
              five different formal frameworks, three different optimal
              algorithms, as well as a series of approximation techniques. The
              paper provides interesting insights into the structure of
              decentralized problems, the expressiveness of the various models,
              and the relative advantages and limitations of the different
              solution techniques. A better understanding of these issues will
              facilitate further progress in the field and help resolve several
              open problems that we identify.},

  abstract = {In a multi-agent system, agents are carrying out certain tasks by
              executing plans. Consequently, the problem of finding a plan, given
              a certain goal, has been given a lot of attention in the
              literature. Instead of concentrating on this problem, the focus of
              this paper is on cooperation between agents which already have
              constructed plans for their goals. By cooperating, agents might
              reduce the number of actions they have to perform in order to
              fulfill their goals. The key idea is that in carrying out a plan an
              agent possibly produces side products that can be used as resources
              by other agents. As a result, an other agent can discard some of
              its planned actions. This process of exchanging products, called
              plan merging, results in distributed plans in which agents become
              dependent on each other, but are able to attain their goals more
              efficiently. In order to model this kind of cooperation, a new
              formalism is developed in which side products are modeled
              explicitly. The formalism is a resource logic based on the notions
              of resource, skill, goal, and service. Starting with some resources
              , an agent can perform a number of skills in order to produce other
              resources which suffice to achieve some given goals. Here, a skill
              is an elementary production process taking as inputs resources
              satisfying certain constraints. A service is a serial or parallel
              composition of skills acting as a program. An operational semantics
              is developed for these services as programs. Using this formalism,
              an algorithm for plan merging is developed, which is anytime and
              runs in polynomial time. Furthermore, a variant of this algorithm
              is proposed that handles the exchange of resources in a more
              flexible way. The ideas in the paper will be illustrated by an
              example from public transportation.},

                  achieve desired goals -- is an important part of intelligent
                  agency and has thus received significant attention within AI
                  for more than 30 years. Work on efficient planning algorithms
                  still continues to be a hot topic for research in AI and has
                  led to several exciting developments i the past few years. This

                  and approaches to the planning problem in AI. To fulfill this

                  synthesis called refinement planning and show that in its

  abstract = {In order to behave intelligently, artificial agents must be able
              to deliberatively plan their future actions. Unfortunately,
              realistic agent environments are usually highly dynamic and only
              partially observable, which makes planning computationally hard.
              For most practical purposes this rules out planning techniques that
              account for all possible contingencies in the planning process.
              However, many agent environments permit an alternative approach,
              namely continual planning, i.e. the interleaving of planning with
              acting and sensing. This paper presents a new principled approach
              to continual planning that describes why and when an agent should
              switch between planning and acting. The resulting continual
              planning algorithm enables agents to deliberately postpone parts of
              their planning process and instead actively gather missing
              information that is relevant for the later refinement of the plan.
              To this end, the algorithm explictly reasons about the knowledge
              (or lack thereof) of an agent and its sensory capabilities. These
              concepts are modelled in the planning language (MAPL). Since in
              many environments the major reason for dynamism is the behaviour of
              other agents, MAPL can also model multiagent environments, common
              knowledge among agents, and communicative actions between them. For
              Continual Planning, MAPL introduces the concept of of assertions,
              abstract actions that substitute yet unformed subplans. To evaluate
              our continual planning approach empirically we have developed
              MAPSIM, a simulation environment that automatically builds
              multiagent simulations from formal MAPL domains. Thus, agents can
              not only plan, but also execute their plans, perceive their
              environment, and interact with each other. Our experiments show
              that, using continual planning techniques, deliberate action
              planning can be used efficiently even in complex multiagent
              environments.},
