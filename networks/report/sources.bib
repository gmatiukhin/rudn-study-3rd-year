              use an IP backbone to provide IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)
              for its customers. This method uses a "peer model", in which the
              customers' edge routers (CE routers) send their routes to the
              Service Provider's edge routers (PE routers); there is no "overlay"
              visible to the customer's routing algorithm, and CE routers at
              different sites do not peer with each other. Data packets are
              tunneled through the backbone, so that the core routers do not need
              to know the VPN routes. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
